# NLP_Minor_Project

## **NLP & Text-Based Modeling: Objective**
This project explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, ranging from data preprocessing and sentiment analysis to advanced topic modeling and explainability. This repository contains the code and resources for the NLP minor project, which explores natural language processing techniques for efficient text analysis and manipulation.

## **Features**
- Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF and word embeddings).
- Sentiment Classification: Compare classical ML models with transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).
- Topic Modeling: Use LDA or BERTopic to extract and visualize latent topics.
- Explainable NLP: Implement tools like LIME, SHAP, and attention heatmaps.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
